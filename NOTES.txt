BUGS:


FEATURES:

  [ ] A send-message-mails command which sends a summary email with all unread messages to the user?
  [ ] Binaries depending on other ones (i.e. libraries, Nginx on OpenSSL etc.)
  [ ] SSEs/WebSocket support for the messages
  [ ] Useful permissions/roles implementation. Roles are useless right now.


HACKS:

  [ ] smartmodel doesn't work with L5.1, so the following hack needs to be applied:
      -> replace line 876 in Ardent with 'return parent::query()->find($id, $columns);'
  [ ] smartmodel used debug_backtrace but does not limit the length. For performance,
      replace the calls with: debug_backtrace(false, 2);  // or 4, depending on function


IMPROVEMENTS:

  [ ] Don't create EOL messages if one already exists
  [ ] Use nested route groups so prefixes are inherited. Doesn't work...
  [ ] Use one global route group with the loggedIn middleware. Doesn't work with prefixes...
