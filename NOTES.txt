BUGS:
    - replace line 876 in Ardent with 'return parent::query()->find($id, $columns);' because Laravel removed the
      find method
    - replace all debug_backtrace(false); with debug_backtrace(false, 2); in Ardent for better performance


FEATURES:
    - A send-message-mails command which sends a summary email with all unread messages to the user
    - ESS/WebSocket support for the messages
    - Useful permissions/roles implementation. Roles are useless right now.
